# pySICM Analysis
Analysis tool for .sicm files created with our home-built Scanning Ion Conductance Microscope (SICM).

This program is loosely based on a Matlab program written by Dr. Patrick Happel. It still has beta status and will be updated infrequently in the future. At the moment, it is limited to display and manipulate data produced by our own SICM setup which is controlled by another python software written by Dr. Patrick Happel.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10
- PyQt 6

### Instructions
Run `python3 sicm_analyzer/main.py` from the project's root folder
